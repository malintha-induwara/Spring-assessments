What are the scopes of spring beans?

by default it has Singleton scope
We can change the type of beans to Singlton,Prototype beans  ( there are also antother two types  Session and Request)


Old spring verison have a beanfactory to create beans but never versions have a method called Application Context, but beanfactory is still used in Spring
lifescycle because of backword compatability


when using Prototype, spring manage the bean untill ready to use stage , after that it throw it away from the application context which mean its no longer a bean and its not manage by the 
spring framework


Config -> Source for bean difination

bean ambiguity spring (when there are similer two bean in the application context, we use ambiguity to define it)

AOP -Aspect orianted programming  (Programming paradime) - Java by deafult doesnt support

For example if there is a Main function called Transaction and you want to log it loggin part is a apsect of transaction


comparative and imparative proramming

imparative mean you have to specifically tell to the programming lanuage what to do (JAVA)
decleative mean you tell the program what you want



@ComponentScan is used to mark beans eligible for application context
