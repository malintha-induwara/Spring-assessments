1) @ComponentScan ->   Tell Go find objects that like to work with spring  
   (basePackages = "lk.ijse.gdse.add") - if you give path like this it only scan this directory and its sub directory
   
   (baseClass = Hello.java) - only the mentioned class
   
   
   
   @Component -> Mark a class as its suitable for work with spring (a calss we created , we have the source code)
   
   
   @Bean -> if we going to register a class that we dont have a source code we use bean annotaion(objects that managed by spring framework)
    these are singleton( we say scope is singleton) if we want we can change the scope
  
   
   @Retecteion -> this is used to tell  in which time the annotation should remove 
   
   @Autowired ->used for dependency injection, it used to tell spring to inject a bean of (that type)  inside application context
   
   
   
   @Qulifer->
   @Primary->
